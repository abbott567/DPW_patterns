          These patterns are intended for use in designing DWP services and
          should be used in the event that the GOV.UK pattern library does not
          contain a viable solution to your design problem.

          For a visual style guide, including front-end code snippets, see the
          GOV.UK elements guide. In addition there is now a DWP elements guide
          that details how to style services that are for DWP staff and for
          services not hosted on GOV.UK.
